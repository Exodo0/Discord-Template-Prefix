## Deployment

To Deploy my  project. You will need a terminal of your choice. In my case I use (CMD, PowerShell)
```bash
Step 1:

npm install

```
Now Open File: Config.json
And Add Your token and Prefix of your preference.

Example:

```bash
{
    "Token": "213133123", Take your Bot Token Here: https://discord.com/developers/applications
    "Prefix": "?"
}

Once you have followed the previous steps you need to make the bot work Use this:

```bash
Step 2:

node .

## FAQ

#### Will I continue to support this?

Yes I will try to support it by providing some commands and functions so that the bot works 100% with the new Discord V14 api.

#### SlashCommand?

Currently working on a functional template with Slash Commands

Even though I already have a 100% developed bot Invite it if you want to try it
